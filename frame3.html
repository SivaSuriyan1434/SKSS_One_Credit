                &emsp; On Friday 17 September 2021, the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group members met virtually to discuss new versions of the 2021 Sustainable Finance Synthesis Report and of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which include comments previously raised by G20 members.<br>
                &emsp; There is broad agreement on the actions and recommendations proposed in the two documents which will be finalized in the coming days. Regarding the Roadmap, the group concurred that the document is well-focused and sufficiently flexible to be expanded, in the next few years, to explore the challenges and opportunities related to other sustainability issues beyond those related to climate change.
